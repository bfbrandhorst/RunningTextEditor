This a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

Welcome to Running Text Editor! This is a single page application that meets and adheres to PWA criteria. Once this application is installed it can be downloaded directly to desktop, it automatically saves content inside the text editor using IndexedDB, and will function without internet connection. As a developer you can use Running Text Editor to create and save notes or code snippets so they can be retrieved at any time for later use. With the use of IndexedDB the application will immedatley have database storage. To see the examples of the application please see the image links below.
